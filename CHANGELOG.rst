1.11.0
================

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- The install script is now shipped in 3 different flavors:

  - ``install_script.sh``, the original and now deprecated script
    that will eventually stop receiving updates.

    unless specified otherwise.
  - ``install_script_agent7.sh``, which uses ``DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7``
    unless specified otherwise.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Ensure ``curl`` is installed on SUSE, because ``rpm --import`` requires it.

- Properly ignore zypper failures with inaccessible repos that aren't
  related to the Agent installation.

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.10.0:

1.10.0
================

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.10.0_New Features:

New Features
------------

- Add FIPS mode.

  When the ``DD_FIPS_MODE`` environment variable is set, the install script
  installs an additional FIPS proxy package and configures Agent to direct
  all traffic to the backend through the FIPS proxy.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.10.0_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Permissions and ownership of the Agent configuration file are now set
  even if it existed before the script was executed.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.9.0:

installscript-1.9.0
===================

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.9.0_Upgrade Notes:

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- Since datadog-agent 6.36/7.36, Debian 7 (Wheezy) is no longer supported,
  ``install_script.sh`` now installs 6.35/7.35 when the minor version is unpinned,
  and ``DD_AGENT_FLAVOR`` doesn't specify a version.

- Allow nightly builds install on non-prod repos.

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.8.0:

installscript-1.8.0
===================

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.8.0_New Features:

New Features

- Enable installation of the datadog-dogstatsd package.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.8.0_Enhancement Notes:

Enhancement Notes

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.8.0_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

  on OpenSUSE 42.

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.7.0:

installscript-1.7.0
===================

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.7.0_Upgrade Notes:

Upgrade Notes
-------------

- Since datadog-agent 6.33/7.33, the SUSE RPMs are only supported on OpenSUSE >= 15
  (including OpenSUSE >= 42) and SLES >= 12. On OpenSUSE < 15 and SLES < 12,
  ``install_script.sh`` now installs 6.32/7.32 when minor version is unpinned
  and ``DD_AGENT_FLAVOR`` doesn't specify version.

- On Debian-based systems, the install script now installs the
  datadog-signing-keys package in addition to the datadog-agent package.

  For users using the official apt.datadoghq.com repository: the datadog-signing-keys
  package is already present in the repository, no further action is necessary.

  For users with custom mirrors or repositories: the datadog-signing-keys
  package must be present in the same repository channel as the datadog-agent
  package, otherwise the install script will fail to install the Agent.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.7.0_Enhancement Notes:

Enhancement Notes
-----------------

- The ``install_script.sh`` now supports AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux installation.
  Note that only datadog-agent, datadog-iot-agent and datadog-dogstatsd since
  version 6.33/7.33 support these distributions, so trying to install older
  versions will fail.

- Environment variable ``ZYPP_RPM_DEBUG`` value is now propagated through
  ``install_script.sh`` to the ``zypper install`` command to enable
  RPM transaction debugging.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.6.0:

installscript-1.6.0
===================

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.6.0_Enhancement Notes:

Enhancement Notes
-----------------

- Suggest installing the IoT Agent on armv7l.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.6.0_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Ensure that Debian/Ubuntu APT keyrings get created world-readable, so that
  the ``_apt`` user can read them.

- Improved detection of systemd as init system.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.5.0:

installscript-1.5.0
===================

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.5.0_New Features:

New Features
------------

- Adds capability to specify a minor (and optional patch) version by setting
  the ``DD_AGENT_MINOR_VERSION`` variable.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.5.0_Enhancement Notes:

Enhancement Notes
-----------------

- Adds email validation before sending a report.

- Improvements for APT keys management

  - By default, get keys from keys.datadoghq.com, not Ubuntu keyserver
  - Always add the ``DATADOG_APT_KEY_CURRENT.public`` key (contains key used to sign current repodata)
  - Add ``signed-by`` option to all sources list lines
  - On Debian >= 9 and Ubuntu >= 16, only add keys to ``/usr/share/keyrings/datadog-archive-keyring.gpg``
  - On older systems, also add the same keyring to ``/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d``


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.5.0_Bug Fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix SUSE version detection algorithm to work without deprecated ``/etc/SuSE-release`` file.


.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.4.0:

installscript-1.4.0
===================

.. _Release Notes_installscript-1.4.0_Enhancement Notes:

Enhancement Notes
-----------------

-  Add a ``gpgkey=`` entry ensuring that ``dnf``/``yum``/``zypper``
   always have access to the key used to sign current repodata.

-  Change RPM key location from yum.datadoghq.com to keys.datadoghq.com.

-  Activate ``repo_gpgcheck`` on RPM repositories by default.
   ``repo_gpgcheck`` is still set to ``0`` when using a custom
   ``REPO_URL`` or when running on RHEL/CentOS 8.1 because of a `bug in
   dnf`_. The default value can be overriden by specifying
   ``DD_RPM_REPO_GPGCHECK`` variable. The allowed values are ``0`` (to
   disable) and ``1`` (to enable).
